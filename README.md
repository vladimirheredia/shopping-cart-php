# shopping-cart-php

This project was part of a final project from school at BU. This is a shopping cart in which we can pull a list of products from a MySQL
database. The products have a details page, add to cart button and a cart page where products added to the cart are added, sub totaled and
taxed. Need to use something like the LAMP stack to run the project

Technologies used:

* PHP
* Javascript
